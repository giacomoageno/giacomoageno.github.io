- ## About me

I am a Research Associate (postdoc) at the University of Cambridge, hosted by [Prof. Pierre RaphaÃ«l](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/pr463).

I obtained my Ph.D. at the University of Bath, under the supervision of [Prof. Manuel del Pino](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/manuel-del-pino). My second supervisor was [Prof. Monica Musso](https://sites.google.com/view/monicamusso/home).

I am interested in qualitative properties of nonlinear PDE, in particular singularity formation in nonlinear evolution equations (Heat, free boundary problems, fluids).
